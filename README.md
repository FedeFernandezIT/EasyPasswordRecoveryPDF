<B>PDF password recovery tool, The smart, the brute and the list.</B>

This password recovery tool is a Windows 10 desktop app (.Net 4.6) which provides an effective way of recovering PDF passwords. The tool uses the itextsharp library to retrieve the hashed user and owner password, after which these hashed passwords are compared to the by the user supplied passwords using dedicated algorithms (including the latest PDF encryption algorithm ISO 32000-2). The user can supply passwords in four different ways, by manually clicking the lock icon, using dictionaries, regular expressions and using a brute force approach. The dictionary editor is shown below.
